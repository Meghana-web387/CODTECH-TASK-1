Overview Of This Project

Project:create a program that converts temperature between celsius,fahrenet,and kelvin.
        the program should allow the user to input a temperture in one scale and output 
        the converted temperature in another scale using c++.


Objectives
User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple and intuitive console interface where users can select their input and target temperature scales.
Accurate Temperature Conversion: Implement precise formulas to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Error Handling: Manage invalid user input (e.g., invalid scale choice) to ensure a smooth user experience.
Key Components

Main Function:
Prompts the user to select an input temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
Prompts the user to input a temperature value.
Prompts the user to select a target scale to convert the temperature into.
Uses a switch statement to call the appropriate conversion function based on user input.

Conversion Functions:

Six functions handle conversions between every possible pair of temperature scales:
Celsius to Fahrenheit
Celsius to Kelvin
Fahrenheit to Celsius
Fahrenheit to Kelvin
Kelvin to Celsius
Kelvin to Fahrenheit
Each function uses standard conversion formulas to ensure accurate results.
User Interaction and Output:

After performing the conversion, the program displays the result along with the target scale.
Provides feedback for invalid input or incorrect scale selections to maintain reliability.

Project Benefits
Reusability: This modular structure allows easy expansion if other scales or additional features are needed.
Educational Value: Great for learning C++ fundamentals such as function creation, conditional statements, and user input handling.
Possible Extensions
Graphical Interface: Enhance user interaction with a graphical user interface (GUI).
More Scales: Add support for other scales like Rankine.
Error Checking: Add advanced error checking to handle temperatures below absolute zero or very high values.
